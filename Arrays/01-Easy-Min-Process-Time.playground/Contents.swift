/* Minimum Processing Time
 
 The first line contains an integer, n, the number of processors.
 The ith of the next n subsequent lines contains an integer, processorTime[i].
 The next line contains an integer, (4 * n), the number of tasks.
 The ith of the next (4 * n) subsequent lines contains an integer, taskTime[i].
 
 E.g:
 STDIN Function
 ----- --------
 number of processors, n = 2
 processorTime = [10, 20]

 num of tasks = 8
 taskTime=[2,3,1,2,5,8,4,3]
